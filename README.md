# Rain World Website
Hello everyone, this is my first project for an indie developer called Videocult. The intention of this project is to propose a re-design of the website of one of Videocult's games called "Rain World", the game in which it is currently my favorite. It has been a very interesting experience working with Videocult and the rest of the people involved in this project such as Akupara Games, which was the company that helped me get to Videocult, the current publisher of the game. I will be updating and supporting the company in terms of website maintenance and other related things, meanwhile, I will be updating this repository frequently and committing new changes if requested by Videocult.

For personal reasons, I will avoid links to any image or design website (such as Figma) containing the final website design, also because it will all depend on Videocult's opinion before it going live.
