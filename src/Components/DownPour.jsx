                                <p>The Artificer is an explosive expert and can transform rocks into grenades and spears into explosive spears, however doing this costs food so they can risk going hungry.</p>

                                <p>The Gourmand loves a good meal and can craft delicious dishes or useful tools for itself with the right materials but his large size makes him slower and less manuverable.</p>
